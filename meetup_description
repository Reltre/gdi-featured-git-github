Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how your code worked before? Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these problems and more!
Git is a popular version control application that can track your code changes and make it easier to collaboration on a project. Win win! This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use Git to keep track of your changes to a project, and how to use GitHub (a hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.
We will start the class by setting up your GitHub account and configuring git on your machine. We will then go through a lecture and exercises to help you get started with Git and GitHub!

This workshop will cover:
• the basic concepts of version control
• git commands to track changes to a small project
• how to use GitHub
• the basics of collaborating on projects with other developers

Want to try git for yourself? GitHub has a 15-minute tutorial you can go through on your own here (http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1).

PREREQUISITES
This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class.

TECH REQUIREMENTS

• A laptop with a power supply.
• A modern browser with either Chrome (https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and the "Web Developer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm)" extension or Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and Firebug (http://getfirebug.com/) installed.
• A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (It's free and available for both Mac and PC).

If you don't have a modern browser and text editor it may take 20 minutes to install prior to class. Please come prepared.
