Interested in tech, but think it's not for you? Do you rarely see people who look like you coding? Afraid you missed your chance by not starting to code at 8?
Then Girl Develop It is for you. This MeetUp is one of our featured introductory classes that will show you that coding is for everyone. Whether you are ready to start your own projects, improve your career or just want to communicate better with the coders in your life, we will help you with the basics.

This 3 hour class is about how to get started with "Git" & "GitHub". Git is a tool to track versions of a project. GitHub is a site to host the project.
It's a great resource that makes it easy to share, collaborate and review the history of your project.
Most tech companies use it and it can even be used for non tech projects (like this presentation).

We'll start with setting up an account on GitHub and the basics of using git. We'll then walk through interactive lessons.


This workshop will cover:
• What is version control?
• Basic git commands
• How to use GitHub for yourself
• How to use GitHub to collaborate with others

If you want to get a headstart, GitHub has a 15-minute tutorial you can go through on your own here (http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1).

PREREQUISITES
This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class.

TECH REQUIREMENTS

• A laptop with a power supply.
• A modern browser with either Chrome (https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and the "Web Developer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm)" extension or Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and Firebug (http://getfirebug.com/) installed.
• A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (It's free and available for both Mac and PC).

If you don't have a modern browser and text editor it may take 20 minutes to install prior to class. Please come prepared.
