Have you ever made changes to a project and wanted to go back, but lost track of where it was? Are you looking to start coding and want to save projects like a professional? Do you want to collaborate on a project?

This class is all about how to get started with "Git" & "GitHub". Git is a tool to track versions of a project. GitHub is a site to host the project. It is a great place to start all your projects to be able to share, collaborate and review the history.
Most tech companies use it and can even be used for non tech projects (like this presentation).

We'll start with setting up an account on GitHub and the basics of using git. We'll then walk through interactive lessons.


This workshop will cover:
• What is version control?
• Basic git commands
• How to use GitHub for yourself
• How to use GitHub to collaborate with others

If you want to get a headstart, GitHub has a 15-minute tutorial you can go through on your own here (http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1).

PREREQUISITES
This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class.

TECH REQUIREMENTS

• A laptop with a power supply.
• A modern browser with either Chrome (https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) and the "Web Developer (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bfbameneiokkgbdmiekhjnmfkcnldhhm)" extension or Firefox (http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and Firebug (http://getfirebug.com/) installed.
• A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (It's free and available for both Mac and PC).

If you don't have a modern browser and text editor it may take 20 minutes to install prior to class. Please come prepared.
